            <h2>Abstract Window Toolkit</h2>
            <div>It is a platform-dependent API to develop GUI (Graphical User Interface) or window-based applications in Java. It was developed by Sun Microsystem In 1995. It is heavy-weight in use because it is generated by the system’s host operating system. It contains a large number of classes and methods, which are used for creating and managing GUI.

            <h2>Abstract Window Toolkit</h2>
            <div>Swing is a part of JFC (Java Foundation Classes). Building Graphical User Interface in Java requires the use of Swings. Swing Framework contain a large set of components which allow high level of customization and provide rich functionalities, and is used to create window based applications.
                Java swing components are lightweight, platform independent, provide powerful components like tables, scroll panels, buttons, list, color chooser, etc.
                In this article, we’ll see how to make frames using Swings in Java. Ways to create a frame.

            <h2>Abstract Window Toolkit</h2>
            <div>To appear onscreen, every GUI component must be part of a containment hierarchy. A containment hierarchy is a tree of components that has a top-level container as its root. We'll show you one in a bit. Each GUI component can be contained only once. If a component is already in a container and you try to add it to another container, the component will be removed from the first container and then added to the second.Each top-level container has a content pane that, generally speaking, contains (directly or indirectly) the visible components in that top-level container's GUI.</div>

            <h2>Abstract Window Toolkit</h2>
            <div>Each program that uses Swing components has at least one top-level container. This top-level container is the root of a containment hierarchy — the hierarchy that contains all of the Swing components that appear inside the top-level container.
                As a rule, a standalone application with a Swing-based GUI has at least one containment hierarchy with a JFrame as its root. For example, if an application has one main window and two dialogs, then the application has three containment hierarchies, and thus three top-level containers. One containment hierarchy has a JFrame as its root, and each of the other two has a JDialog object as its root.</div>

            <h2>Abstract Window Toolkit</h2>
            <div>It's easy to customize the content pane — setting the layout manager or adding a border, for example. However, there is one tiny gotcha. The getContentPane method returns a Container object, not a JComponent object. This means that if you want to take advantage of the content pane's JComponent features, you need to either typecast the return value or create your own component to be the content pane. Our examples generally take the second approach, since it's a little cleaner. Another approach we sometimes take is to simply add a customized component to the content pane, covering the content pane completely.</div>

            <h2>Abstract Window Toolkit</h2>
            <div>Each top-level container relies on a reclusive intermediate container called the root pane. The root pane manages the content pane and the menu bar, along with a couple of other containers. You generally don't need to know about root panes to use Swing components. However, if you ever need to intercept mouse clicks or paint over multiple components, you should get acquainted with root panes.</div>
