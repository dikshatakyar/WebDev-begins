        <h2>Blogs</h2>
        <div>The job of the news is to terrify you. Studies have shown that people who watch the news are actually less realistic than possibilitarians because they get a skewed version of reality.
            Yes, it’s smart to check in every few days or so on what’s happening so you can protect your family and pivot in your business.But spending hours each day watching events you cannot control is toxic. And causes you to miss out on the opportunity that this time of exponential quietude presents to do monumental work that moves the world higher.</div>

        <h2>Victory hour</h2>
        <div>The first hour of your day has an outsized effect on the positivity of the hours that follow. Own your mornings and you win your days, right?
            I encourage you to start with sweaty exercise and then include some time for prayer, meditation, journaling and reading.</div>

        <h2>From the best authors</h2>
        <div>Losing yourself in the service of others is a beautiful formula for becoming happier as we navigate the pandemic.
            Find a crusade. Detect a mighty mission that will consume you, taking your mind and heart off of the messiness that’s all around us.
            To lead is to serve. And to help is to prosper.</div>
