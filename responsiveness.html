            <p> Some seasons will bring misfortune and some times will be hard. In the quiet times of my own life’s largest heartbreaks, I retreated from the world [like a wounded animal retreats to the woods for healing]. And I remained in the wilderness—befriending the pain and allowing it to purify me as much as possible.</p>
            <p>Heroes don't just live in the sunshine. What made Martin Luther King, Martin Luther King, what made JFK, JFK, what made Mother Teresa, Mother Teresa, what made Jean-Michel Basquiat the great artist who he was. What makes a tight enough industry so powerful, what makes a great humanitarian, or a great mother or father, or a firefighter, or a pizza maker who they are, is really not who they are in the times when they're at the top of the mountain. We become heroes of our lives by how we endure and navigate the periods that break our hearts.And I suggest to you, with great love and respect, that if you really want to live a rich life, then appreciate the seasons. We all get our times in the sun. And every authentic, real, fully alive human life has those seasons when we're away from the world and we're in the wilderness.</p>
